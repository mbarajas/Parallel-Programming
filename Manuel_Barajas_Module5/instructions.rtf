Implement a parallel sorting algorithm on a 1,000,000-element integer array using only the concurrent programming support provided by POSIX threads. The array is to contain the unique values 1 to 1,000,000. Use 100,000 random interchanges to scramble the array before sorting. Include code to verify that the array is in sorted order after your algorithm executes. Time your sorting algorithm. Turn in the output listing of the time, a description of the algorithm that you used, and a listing of the code.
